# Mainbus-Indicator

Mainbus-Indicator is a factorio mod that indicates where the mainbus lanes are going to be.

## ToDo

* Show sprite every x tile
* Change how the items are retrieved (right now, we retrieve the on_built_entities, so if you load a game, the functionality doesn't work)
* Add settings for: 
  * Line's length
  * Gaps and dashes' length
  * Showing sprites every x tile
  * Distance between each sprite (after this feature is implemented)
  * Line's color
